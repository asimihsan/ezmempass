# Introduction

Using EzMemPass you can create strong, easy to remember passwords. Use these passwords for very important services like your email account, or your password manager.

The **memory aid** is made up of words, and the first three letters of each word make up your **password**.

For example, a password could be:

> foobanmadava

and a corresponding memory aid could be:

> food bank made available

The password on its own is difficult to remember. However with a memory aid the password is easier to remember. The password is the first three letters of each word.

# How passwords are created

- Find the 1024 most popular three-letter prefixes in the language, e.g. English.
- Choose N prefixes at random.
- Try to come up with a plausible sequence of words that match each prefix.

The passwords are easier to remember than random characters because EzMemPass provides a memory aid. However the password is more secure then choosing a real sentence from a language because EzMemPass chooses prefixes at random.
  
# Strength of passwords

Each word adds 10 bits of security. Hence a password of 7 words is recommended for regular use, and 10 or more words for very important passwords such as for password managers.

Adding capital letters, digits, or symbols is there just to satisfy the password rules of some services and websites and not to add to the stength of the passwords.
