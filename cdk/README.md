## Introduction

iOS requires apps to have privacy policies. This CDK stack's job is to deploy a static website to https://ezmempass-privacy-policy.ihsan.io which contains the same privacy policy as is inside the app.

## CDK generic welcome

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
