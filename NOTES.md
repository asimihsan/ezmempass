## Thu 2020-01-09 notes

-   Update `cargo build` to not build bench
-   Add instruction to install Java
-   Change Android target to `flutterBuildAndroidApks`
-   Why doesn't `flutter pub get` work on Windows? Path issue?
-   Integration test doesn't work because there's a new help screen
-   Help screen is broken on landscape
